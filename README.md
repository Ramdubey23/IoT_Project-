Fully Automated Solar Grass Cutter
The objective of the proposed work is to design and construct the grass cutter. It also avoids obstacles without the need of any human interaction. The system uses batteries to power the vehicle movement motors as well as the grass cutter motor. The grass cutter and vehicle motors are interfaced to Arduino that controls the working of all the motors. It is also interfaced to an Ultrasonic sensor for object detection. The Arduino controller moves the vehicle motors in forward direction in case no obstacle is detected. On obstacle detection ultrasonic sensor monitors it and the controller thus rotates the grass cutter motor so as to avoid any damage to the object/human/animal. Controller then moves the grass cutter in forward direction again.
The project aims at fabricating a robot which can be used for both cleaning homes and maintenance of lawns economically. Purpose of this project is to reduce the cost of labor induced. It also aims at reducing the human efforts with increase in efficiency and preciseness.
